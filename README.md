<center><img src="ezgif-7-aca9c7888d.gif" height="200"> <sub>Sample logo created in Canva</sub></center><br><br>

Simple yet dynamic portfolio, well-suited for visual showcases (illustration, graphic design, photography). Includes customizable social media links, multiple page tabs, and mobile device compatibility. 
<br>
I initially built this webpage code for personal use to display my digital illustrations and logo designs. Said project is currently in-progress! 
<br>
Future updates: incorporating more advanced web design features (interactivity, improved accessibility, image upload functions)
